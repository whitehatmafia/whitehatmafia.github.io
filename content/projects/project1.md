## Overview
PodPet Defender transforms traditional honeypot monitoring into an engaging experience by representing each container instance as a virtual pet that reacts to and visualizes attack attempts in real-time. The project combines container security with game mechanics to make cybersecurity monitoring more intuitive and interactive.

## Key Features
- Interactive dashboard showing container 'pets' with health status and mood based on attack patterns
- Real-time visualization of attack attempts with pet reactions and animations
- Automated container rotation and health regeneration system
- Attack pattern recognition and classification system
- Detailed attack logs with playful pet-themed notifications
- REST API for external monitoring and integration
- Customizable pet personalities based on container configurations

## Technical Details
The core system uses Podman for lightweight container management, Python for backend processing, and Vue.js for the interactive frontend. NetworkX handles attack pattern visualization, while Flask serves the API. SQLite stores attack histories and pet states. Container health is monitored through custom Python scripts that analyze network traffic and system calls.

## Challenges & Solutions
- Challenge: Making container security monitoring engaging
  Solution: Implemented a pet-care metaphor where attacks affect pet happiness and health
- Challenge: Resource management for multiple honeypot instances
  Solution: Developed an intelligent container rotation system using Podman's lightweight architecture
- Challenge: Real-time attack visualization
  Solution: Created a WebSocket-based event system for immediate pet reactions to detected threats
